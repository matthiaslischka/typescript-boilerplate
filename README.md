# typescript-boilerplate

## This is not the typescript boilerplate you are looking for.

This is merely a personal attempt to do a somewhat solid boilerplate from scratch. There are already plenty way better and very powerful boilerplates for the different usages out there:

[TypeScript Starter](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter)

[Angular Starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-starter)

[TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter)

[Ionic](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic)

...and so on.

### Ok, but why this then?
Why did I reinvent the wheel here? Again, this is my *personal* attempt. I think, it is important to do a somewhat solid initial setup at least once by oneself in order to get a good understanding of how things come together.
